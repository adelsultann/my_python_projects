"Might last a year tops.","The mic sounds great but this mic will only last you a year tops. I've gone through two of these now and around the one year mark right when the warranty expires it starts to develop issues with the mute/volume control knob. There is a manufacturing defect in these mics. I've seen other people complain of the same issue. The sound gets staticy and sometimes completely cut out. When I have the wheel max its not at full volume, I have to bring the wheel down a notch for it work. This happened on 2 separate units. I'd recommend a different mic instead because of this major issue.","27 Dec 2018","Style: Boom Mic","","Yes","v0rt3x","3.0","V-MODA BoomPro Microphone for Gaming & Communication - Black","https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication/product-reviews/B00BJ17WKK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Paired with Sony WH-1000mx4 for ""gaming"" headset with PS5 & Series X","Working with PS5 and Xbox Series X! UPDATE April 22 - So not long after my last update, just before the 1-year mark, the mute switch seemed to stop working.. and then a week or 2 later the audio started having issues until a day when it just stopped working. Fortunately, it was still under warranty and the process was a little lengthy and convoluted.. but I was sent a replacement in the mail. Took a few weeks though. In the end, the mic costs $35 and works better than my previous Astro headset did, so I'm keeping my score 5star. Personally, if it had broken a few months later off of warranty, I probably would have just bought a new one. Until there is a reliable wireless gaming headset that I can trust, I'm gonna stick with this system. UPDATE Jan 22 - Still working like a charm. I have stopped using my $300ish dollar Astro 50 wireless headset because it was so unreliable with popping in and out audio. Been using this with my Sony headset like a charm for both Xbox Series X and PS5 Been using it several months now; so far so good! I pair it with my Sony WH-1000xm4 headset, which plugs into my Dualsense control for the PS5, or my Xbox Elite control for Xbox Series X. Has worked perfectly so far with both consoles. The controls on the cord allow you to mute the mic, and raise/lower volume on the headset. Still able to use my headset's noise canceling or sound pass-through features with the mic plugged in. The drawback remains that disconnecting the mic all the time and having no case for it will probably lead to me breaking it eventually. Only other downside (for me, may be good for you) is the cable is very long. I only need a few feet of length so I bought a cable manager to wrap it up.","01 Dec 2020","Style: Boom Mic","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1YHrtZp1tL._SY88.jpg

"Works perfect - after a little hands-on work","I got this used, and I'm guessing I know why the last person returned it - when I first plugged it into my headphones it sounded awful. The bass was empty and replaced with a distorted hiss which is the telltale sign that the plug isn't in all the way. Sure enough, if I grabbed and pushed the plug into my headphones super hard it sounded fine... but once I let go it would sound awful again. So I had to take a pair of sharp scissors and very careful trim away a tiny sliver of the plastic rim that surrounds the base of the 3.5mm plug so that about 1mm more of it was exposed and able to slide into the headphone. Works perfect now! The only thing wrong was that it had too much plastic on the 3.5mm plug going into the headphone. Such a weird defect, but easy to fix. Besides that odd manufacturing defect, the rest of the product works flawlessly. The mic isn't going to get an award for noise cancellation but it isn't super-sensitive to background noise either. Voice quality is definitely good enough for gaming/discord, and the mic is adjustable so you can put it where you want around your face to avoid breathing on it. It's a lot cheaper than a ModMic and it's easier to use - this is just ONE cable that you plug into your headphone, then unplug when you're done, as opposed to having a separate mic with its own separate cable and separate attachment. So that's very handy, and it allows me to easily turn my headphones into a full-on gaming headset!","14 Jun 2019","Style: Boom Mic","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610TkHXb0AL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Dave","4.0","V-MODA BoomPro Microphone for Gaming & Communication - Black","https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication/product-reviews/B00BJ17WKK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Almost as clear as my professional studio microphone.","As a non-gamer, I bought this for video voice overs, skype, podcasting and for use with my video camera. Now, I think this won't work with my DSLR or Canon Vixia video camera, because they require a ""line level"" input from a powered microphone such as the Vid-Pro lavalier microphone sold on Amazon, which takes a button cell battery and has a tiny amplifier in it. Cons: The 1/8"" Y cable that comes with this is terrible. It plugs in very tight, and will never come out. But it feels permanent, once plugged in, and barely comes back out. I felt like I might break the cable trying to remove the 2 little 90 degree plugs from my computer. I would suggest buying a new headset microphone adapter Y cable, for $5 on Amazon that has straight plugs. The cord is nice and braided which feels nice, but it does create a little bit of noise when you brush it against a zipper on a sweater or coat. Not a big deal. The microphone picks up a very slight echo speaking into my custom cubicle style work desk, unless I turn it so the microphone holes are facing up and down, which completely removes any echo. The microphone won't work with my Scarlett preamp designed for large professional microphones. Pros: This V-Moda microphone sounds more clear and accurate than a professional XM8500 stage microphone I recently purchased, which sounds very dense, muffled and muddy in comparison to the V-Moda microphone. After seeing how tiny the V-Moda was, holding it in my hand, I was extremely skeptical that it could reproduce the Human voice properly without seriously distorting the frequency and tone like many other tiny non-powered microphones or cheap headset microphones. Well, the V-Moda BoomPro is not an ordinary cheap microphone. It was engineered by real sound engineers, because it blocks background sound better than my $100 studio microphone, and sounds almost as clear. The V-Moda is more a bass and mid range microphone, picking up the lows very well, without picking up the really low lows that cause distortion and muddiness. It seems to have just the right frequency response for picking up the Human voice. It does not pick up the ultra low rumbling frequencies or the ultra high shrill background noises. Somehow, the itty-bitty tiny little microphone that is nearly invisible, it records big booming sound, and reproduces my speaking voice with clarity and authority. The V-Moda is worth every penny, because it is as good as advertised. Observations and Technical Breakdown: The V-Moda doesn't reproduce the Human voice accurately. None of the microphones I've ever used sound totally natural. Microphones convert your voice into an electronic signal, so there will always be some kind of coloration of the tone of your voice, music recorded in the background, etc. The V-Moda is a little bit heavy in the low mid range area, and a little light in the high end frequency spectrum. It's designed intentionally this way to prevent background noise and to prevent shrill unnecessary high pitched sounds from being picked up by the microphone. I am perfectly happy with the sound tone of the V-Moda for Skype calls and phone calls, as it's nearly perfect. Using default settings, the V-Moda sounds more clear and less muddy than my Behringer XM8500 microphone, which was pretty shocking considering the size difference. I've heard many small microphones that sound so muffled and terrible that they are mostly useless .The V-Moda sounds very similar to my inexpensive studio microphone, an AKG P120 condenser microphone, which uses 48 volts and a preamp, a Scarlett 2i2 2nd generation. For video voice over work, the V-Moda is too mid-bass heavy for my taste. Surprisingly the V-Moda microphone seems to automatically block out frequencies below 100hz, preventing any heavy bass noises from ruining the sound. But if you want your voice to sound absolutely natural, you'll need to do some editing in a sound editor or use some kind of an equalizer. This is for people who are using this to make professional recordings. Now, again I was skeptical that this microphone could be good enough to make a professional recording. But indeed it can. You will need to do a little editing. I'll tell you how I was able to do it. First, you'll need a new computer sound card. Unless you you have a really good internal sound card in your computer, or a professional recording studio, you might get too much line noise from the cheap internal microphone port on your laptop or computer. Every computer is different. However, my laptop and my PC computer both have a lot of line noise when I use a microphone on the factory microphone input jack. I tried using the V-Moda on a Sound Blaster Audigy sound card and there was absolutely no audible line noise or hissing. This is called signal to noise ratio. Add-on sound cards that you purchase separately may be better than the internal sound card, so if you get line noise, I would recommend either buying a Sound Blaster Audigy (Open your computer and check for open PCI & PCI express slots). They make PCI or PCI Express sound cards. Or you can get a USB sound card.  I found a really good PCI sound card that also doubles as a professional headphone amplifier. It's called the ASUS Xonar DG 5.1 Channels PCI Interface Sound Card. You can get it here on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2AVdJQm This ASUS DG sound card is designed for headsets, it has a very high signal strength so it doesn't have any line noise, and it has a built in amplifier to power expensive headphones. People report a noticeable improvement using this sound card with headphones. The ASUS DG sound card actually has an adjustable output for different types of headphones, so it can work with cheap headphones or professional 600 ohm headphones which usually require an expensive external headphone amplifier. You can configure it for different headphone OHM ratings. I've never seen this feature on any other sound cards, especially internal factory sound cards. Sound Editing: Back to the V-Moda microphone. What makes a good microphone good is it's ability to maintain the information being recorded. If you lose certain frequencies or distort the voice too much, you cannot use sound editing to fix the sound. No amount of editing can fix a bad microphone, because the sound is lost before it gets recorded. The V-Moda handles sound editing extremely well. Again, I was shocked. It's not as good as my AKG P120, but it's close enough after editing, that no normal person would ever notice a difference. The V-Moda does cut off a lot of the high frequencies and it does boost some of the low-mids, naturally, due to its design. You won't be able to magically recreate the missing high frequency sounds, but for voice recordings, that's perfectly fine and even desired in most situations. High frequency sounds are rarely desired in voice recordings, and the most popular radio broadcast microphones today have a sound tone that is very similar to this V-Moda microphone, with muted treble. The V-Moda does't have an absolutely accurate sound tone, it sounds a little bit amplified in the mid bass area, but with some sound equalizer adjustments in a sound editor program, you can make the tone sound more natural, just by reducing some of the mid bass. If you just get a free program like Audacity, then you can record your voice, then edit the sound using the built in equalizer to get the exact sound you want. I am convinced that the V-Moda records with enough quality that you can safely edit the sound recording without losing a significant amount of the audio integrity. In conclusion: The V-Moda sounds slightly muted, slightly muffled, and slightly boosted in the lower-mid bass region. But it appears to be perfectly tailored to picking up the Human voice, and blocking out things happening in the background. It's obviously a very carefully engineered microphone, and is shockingly good for the price. Unlike other microphones which sound wretched and painful to the ears, this V-Moda microphone has a very smooth, very warm sound tone, that is very clear. I am so happy to know that engineers actually engineered this microphone, unlike 99% of the other microphones out there in this price range which appear to be random accidents, and have no ability to recreate the Human voice. You'll need sound editing to remove some of the mid-bass in order to make this microphone record more accurately, but with some sound editing, I think you can make this microphone sound good enough that you won't need to ever buy a more expensive professional grade microphone. I would consider this a professional microphone for home users and hobbyists. If you need something better than this, than I would suggest getting a dynamic microphone like the Shure SM57 with an extra heavy duty gray foam wind sock, a Shure SM7, or an AKG D5. Then you'll need a preamp like a Scarlett 2i2 USB, and a 15 foot XLR microphone cable. If you need super fine sensitivty and detail, then purchase a 48 volt powered condenser microphone like the AKG P120, and a microphone stand with a boom arm on it, then you can hear a pin drop, literally. You'll want to buy a Sound Blaster Audigy or the ASUS DG sound card if you are using a PC computer, if you hear too much white noise in the background in your recordings. Start first by turning down the gain, and looking for updated drivers for your factory sound card. Edit: 11/23/2017 I received my Asus Xonar DG sound card for my 5 year old motherboard with a PCI slot on Windows 7. The sound card microphone input jack used with the V-Moda BoomPro is absolutely crystal clear, without a trace of any line noise or white noise. This V-Moda microphone sounds even better now, more natural sounding, and even more clear. I am shocked at how much better a $30 sound card can make the microphone sound. If you are having sound issues or having too much line noise, or not enough gain, try getting a new sound card. V-Moda vs. Golden Age Project D2 microphone. I bought a new dynamic professional microphone and tested it against the V-Moda yesterday. The Golden Age Project D2 sounds much worse than then V-Moda BoomPro. The same for the XM8500, which sounds much worse, but better than the D2. Again, I am so surprised. The D2 microphone was $150, but it sounds like you are speaking into a plastic bucket, compared to the natural clarity of the V-Moda. The V-Moda so far, sounds better than 2 other non-powered microphones I've tried which are far more expensive. The ASUS sound card is not perfect, it has caused my computer to lock up a few times with a blue screen, if I try to use my Scarlett Focusrite at the same time, to record multiple devices at the same time. It also takes a moment to begin recording when you engage the sound card, because it has to charge up the capacitors. The Asus sound card software allows you to do realtime ""EQ"" adjustment of your microphone input, and it sounds excellent, with an improvement in the high frequency response of the Vmoda mic, which, for the price of the sound card ($30) is truly amazing. With the treble turned up, the Vmoda sounds even more clear and crisp. Conclusion: Get a new computer sound card, and don't worry about buying a professional condenser or studio microphone. Get the V-Moda.","17 Nov 2017","Style: Boom Mic","","Yes","Charles Seiler","5.0","V-MODA BoomPro Microphone for Gaming & Communication - Black","https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication/product-reviews/B00BJ17WKK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Awesome System for my Philips Fidelio X2!","I have Philips Fidelio X2 and this thing works awesome and so much more clearer than my old Logitech USB Desktop mic. One thing to note is I used the splitter it came with and the Mic went into my motherboard and the headphone went into my Schiit Fulla 2 and got really loud buzzing noises. The reason for this is you now have two different grounds in the cable. To solve this issue I would highly suggest that you get the Mpow Ground Loop Noise Isolator on Amazon. This will solve you buzzing noise but be warned that you will need to turn up your amp since this will take away some of the power in the line.","21 Jul 2017","Style: Boom Mic","","Yes","Foamy","5.0","V-MODA BoomPro Microphone for Gaming & Communication - Black","https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication/product-reviews/B00BJ17WKK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Seamlessly transforms your hi-fi headphones into a gaming headset!","Update (August 2019): I’ve added the Philips SHP9500 headphones to my arsenal, and using it with the BoomPro is amazing. No adapter needed, literally just plug and play. Perfect. The V-Moda BoomPro mic is an amazing attachment to any headphone with a 3.5mm AUX port, easily converting your favorite headphones into a gaming headset. I use this with my Bose QC35 and a 3.5mm Female to 2.5mm Male adapter from RadioShack's online store (yes, they do still exist). I bring my gaming laptop when I travel for work, and this setup pairs extremely well and the mic quality is incredible. I did a simple record and playback test using the Windows 10 built-in Voice Recorder app and compared this to the Corsair Void Pro Wireless headset, which I use at home on my gaming PC. The BoomPro sounds much fuller and true picking up more deep and bassy tones, while the Void Pro's mic sounds compressed and nasally, which is basically the difference between using a mic plugged in vs wireless. The BoomPro does not come with a pop filter/foam cover, but I just took the foam cover off of an Xbox One headset I had laying around, and it fit perfectly. One bit to mention regarding the mic arm is that it is very flexible which is great to get the mic in the perfect position, but it is easily moved with any force. Not a pro nor a con, but some people may find the sensitivity of the arm annoying. Overall, I am very pleased with the BoomPro/QC35 pairing. Anyone looking to use their beloved headphones to game without using a dedicated ""gaming headset"" will find that the V-Moda BoomPro seamlessly transforms your hi-fi headphones into a gaming headset.","30 Jun 2018","Style: Boom Mic","","Yes","Junstar","5.0","V-MODA BoomPro Microphone for Gaming & Communication - Black","https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication/product-reviews/B00BJ17WKK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Broke after 5 months","At first this was the best mic I used as it worked with my ATH-M50x flawlessly. The mic quality was great and I did not hear any deterioration  in audio quality while gaming or watching videos. Unfortunately, the build quality really started to show after five months. I started experiencing major issues with the mic - it was cutting in and out, and sometimes not working all together. I tested it out on multiple computers and headsets with the same issue. Furthermore, the mute switch did not always work and mic was still picking up audio when the switch was on mute (confirmed by my avatar lighting up on Discord and on the Windows recording device window). I contacted support a few months ago as I was still under warranty for a replacement. I sent all my information in on the website and I received an email stating that my ""request has been deemed solved."" Well, it's now June and no replacement has arrived and I have since tossed out the defective pair. It truly is unfortunate that this is the case since this seems to be the only mic that truly worked with mic-less headphones. I will be looking for alternatives that will hopefully be a better investment and offer more longevity.","17 Jun 2019","Style: Boom Mic","","Yes","Broscofs","1.0","V-MODA BoomPro Microphone for Gaming & Communication - Black","https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication/product-reviews/B00BJ17WKK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Turns my M50xBT headphones into a great sounding gaming headset!","I love my Audio-Technica M50xBT headphones, I got them after about 3 years of owning the original wired M50x's, and was really excited when they added a Bluetooth version. One thing I always wanted to do with my original M50x's though was gaming, with a boom mic like a headset for chat, as I never really liked most ""gaming headsets"" and didn't see the point in having a second set of headphones like that when I like my M50s so much and they sound good with so many different audio types whether it be music, movies or games. Unfortunately though because of the proprietary cable it uses, the only solution I could find was something like an Antlion Modmic. That leaves you with 2 cables and 2 plugs to deal with, and a very long cable coming from the ModMic, and since I mostly play on console I would have to adapt them to 1 TRRS 4 pole headset jack to go into my controller anyway. Far from elegant. So when I found out the M50X BTs have a 3.5mm jack for wired audio, I was super excited! I could use this V-Moda Boompro. And what a pairing! The plug is slim enough to fit the recessed jack on the headphones and I like the 45° or so angled plug on the end that goes to your PC/controller better than both straight plugs and right-angle plugs. The cord itself feels very premium too, and the mute/volume module is in a good spot along the cord to reach by feel. Also like the clip on the back of that module to clip it to my shirt and take some of the weight off, and to keep any tugs on the cable from affecting the connection to the headphones.  The sound quality into the headphones is unchanged, sounds just as good as the included cable, and the mic quality is crystal clear! Lots of compliments from others when testing it in a chat party. There is no pop filter, but P and B and S etc. sounds don't seem to be a problem, plus it keeps the mic nice and slim. The boom is nice and flexible, but stays where you put it too. Overall very happy with this accessory, and it's become indispensable in my gaming setup! Oh, it of course also comes with a splitter to go to separate mic and headphone jacks for the PC Master Race peeps.","05 Jul 2020","Style: Boom Mic","","Yes","Stephen","5.0","V-MODA BoomPro Microphone for Gaming & Communication - Black","https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication/product-reviews/B00BJ17WKK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Do not gift for other people - poor build quality","Purchased in September 4, broke December 18. It's like reverse-Christmas. Yay. I think I figured out why so many people's headphones stopped working. The jack going into the headphones is prone to breaking and the wires fraying. I'm willing to bet that all the other customers who experienced hearing loss in their headphones actually had an issue where the wires and the jack were damaged inside the housing. To be fair, the customer support help provided a 50% discount for the purchase of another BoomPro which I gladly accepted, but I don't expect the replacement to last long. It feels wrong to have to pay $30 + tax and then another $15 + tax + shipping (discount provided through their website so no use of Prime) for a total of $50+ in the span of 3 months. This is definitely not a $50 product.","19 Dec 2019","Style: Boom Mic","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618Fq87IJRL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Tae K.","1.0","V-MODA BoomPro Microphone for Gaming & Communication - Black","https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication/product-reviews/B00BJ17WKK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"It's as good as this type of product can be, but there are some caveats...","I originally wrote a harsh review, but after testing it more and learning about the inherent electrical limitations of having a microphone signal and a headphone signal in the same cable, I have become more understanding of why the product works the way it does. Essentially, there are two issues I have with the product, but I learned that it's not really possible to build a 2-in-1 product of this style without those issues, so I've decided to come back and give a better review. Issue 1: the microphone MUTE does not work like like you probably expect. It does not cut completely cut the power to the microphone. Instead, it reduces the microphone gain by a huge amount, such that the mic is technically always on even when muted, but the volume just gets very very low; nobody on the other end would hear any sound from the mic when it's muted unless you screamed directly into it, and even then, it would be a very faint sound. Apparently, this is because cutting off the mic circuit completely would effectively change the design of the electrical circuit, creating undesirable pops and volume changes that would affect the headphone signal that you are hearing, so the tradeoff was just to reduce the mic gain to essentially zero, leaving the circuit intact. It's a cheap, simple solution that allows this product to hit its price point. The GROUND HUM, on the other hand, may be more or less apparent depending on your exact situation; for me, the ground hum is always there, but it is manageable. That's because the mic and headphone signals are sharing a common electrical ground. The hum is always there, but it's very faint if you have your mic gain set correctly. It does not become noticeable until you induce a ground loop; what I mean is, any time I touch the flexible boom portion of the mic with one of my hands, I get a very pronounced GROUND LOOP HUM. This hum goes away completely if I touch any metal portion of my computer chassis with my other hand. The hum is most pronounced when I plug the headphone and mic into the front panel of my desktop; it is still present but less obnoxious when I plug them into the Rear IO panel, and it is even less pronounced when I plug them into an external DAC/AMP that supports mic input, but even with the external DAC/AMP, the hum is still present. Again, my new understanding after looking into this phenomenon is that this is just an inherent limitation of this type of product where the mic and headphone signals are combined on the same cable, and if you want to eliminate it completely, then you need to buy a microphone that uses a completely separate cable, or a microphone that is wireless. Basically, you would need to buy one of the much more expensive competing products from Antlion. Now that I understand that there are hard limitations that the product cannot overcome no matter how hard it tries, I view it differently. I think that, given those limitations, it's doing about the best job that it can. Those problems can be completely fixed by getting different products that cost more money and require the use of a second cable, but those problems can also be mitigated by setting your levels correctly. So, in context of that understanding, I think this is about the best combined microphone/headphone cable you can find, but be aware that it may require a little more adjustment than you expect in order to get it to work just right, and even then, it will still have a ground hum when you touch the boom. If you can live with that, then get it.","30 Nov 2021","Style: Boom Mic","","Yes","Gigabitz","4.0","V-MODA BoomPro Microphone for Gaming & Communication - Black","https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication/product-reviews/B00BJ17WKK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
